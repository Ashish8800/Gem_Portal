This document provides an overview of the file naming conventions used in the GeM Portal Bids program.

## Daily Bids Files

### File name for Daily bids:

- When the daily search start then it will crate with all the bids data: `GeM_all_bids_YYYY-MM-DD.xlsx`

- When there are no newly created files in the past 100 days for comparison: `GeM_Daily_bids_YYYY-MM-DD.xlsx`
- When there is a file present from the past days for comparison: `GeM_Daily_bids_YYYY-MM-DD.xlsx`

- When multiple keywords have the same bid data in their rows, the data is combined into a single row and the column is updated with the keywords having the same data: `GeM_Daily_bids_YYYY-MM-DD_having_duplicated_data.xlsx`

## Search Bids Files (No Date Filter)

### File name for Search bids when dates for filtering data are not given:

- When no keyword has the same data as other keywords: `GeM_searched_bids_YYYY-MM-DD_XXXXXXXX.xlsx`

- When there are some keywords whose row data is the same, their keywords are combined into one column with the data: `GeM_searched_bids_YYYY-MM-DD_XXXXXXXX_having_duplicated_data.xlsx`

## Search Bids Files (With Date Filter)

### File name for Search bids when dates are given:

- When no keyword has the same data as other keywords: `GeM_searched_bids_START_DATE_END_DATE_XXXXXXXX.xlsx`

- When there are some keywords whose row data is the same, their keywords are combined into one column with the data: `GeM_searched_bids_START_DATE_END_DATE_XXXXXXXX_having_duplicated_data.xlsx`

Please note that in the file names:

- `YYYY` represents the year,
- `MM` represents the month,
- `DD` represents the day,
- `XXXXXXXX` represents a unique identifier.

These naming conventions help to identify and differentiate the different types of bid files generated by the GeM Portal Bids program.
